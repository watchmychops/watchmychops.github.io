Discovered that you get one free sub domain (albeit with github.io domain) with GitHub Pages. Think it's a good idea to record a daily log of my work on my final year project. I will pretty much just dump my thoughts in here around the development and progress on the report. There is around a month to go until the hand in and I feel like I've made decent progress towards my project. The temporary solution is close to going live at work on two machines (FN220/3 and FN220/4), but I will focus to change the console application to a windows service together with a API.

I started a web project to handle the dashboard part of my project, but not much work has been completed and no real thought has been put in to how best lay out the information. I definitely think it will be cool to utilise SVG. I have only done a little in my previous job, but I think it's really cool to construct images with "no pixellation" like real images, all using XML. I think it will suit as a good technology to use together with a generic Blazor framework to show the status of each work order per machine. Will have to get in touch with moulding people to understand their needs going towards a new system.

Tomorrow I will summarise the status of each coding project, and maybe review my work items for each.
